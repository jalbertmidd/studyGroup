# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout meetings and in interactions online associated with the Middlebury Humanities Data Study Group.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in the Study Group - facilitators, learners, and guests - is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Facilitators will enforce this code, but you may also contact us directly by email at <rclement@middlebury.edu> or <kgolubiewskidavis@middlebury.edu>. All communication will be treated as confidential.


* The Middlebury Humanities Data Study Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor.
* We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
* Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the group facilitators.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.
