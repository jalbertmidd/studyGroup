# Introduction

These are the notes that are a follow-up to our first meeting. There is info about future meetings, format of meetings, and a link to some resources for learning about R included.

# Notes

1. Format of Future Meetings & Supplemental Questions
  - Future meetings will be held, for the time being, on an every-other-week schedule, to facilitate learning and keep everyone on track
  - For future meetings, the group will know ahead of time what chapter is to be covered, and will receive a list of selected supplmental questions from Ryan/Kristy to go through
  - Going through further supplemental questions is not required but is encouraged
  - We suggest working through material in 30-60 minute blocks, unless you have a better rhythm that works for you
  - **Ryan and Kristy are always available for help**
  - Help your fellow group members as you can! See below for more info
2. Problems with R or RStudio installation?
  - See Ryan or Kristy for assistance, or post a question on the group GitHub
  - Make sure you have both R *and* RStudio installed (they are separate!)
