This is the agenda for our kick-off meeting for the _Humanities Data in R_ study group!

1. Introductions - who we are, what we know already, what we want to get out of group
2. Format of our meetings - our thoughts, group's thoughts, consensus
3. Any problems/technical difficulties with getting R/RStudio installed?
4. Quick intro to RStudio
5. What did you think of the first chapter? What problems/questions did you have?
6. Supplemental questions? Do we want to go through some of those together? Would that be helpful?
7. What later chapters are most interesting to the group?
8. Moving forward, do you want code/questions to be public or private? Can use Github, OSF, or some combination depending on preferences.
